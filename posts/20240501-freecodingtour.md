As a programming and artificial intelligence teacher for students with no prior knowledge, as well as university students, I always face two problems:

1. Different learning paces for each student
2. Constantly new content

[FreeCodingTour.com](https://www.freecodingtour.com) tries to solve these problems in the following way:

- Practical guide with problems and solutions to progress independently
- Updated, free content in Spanish for all students, current and former

From this, a new goal emerges: to bring this free educational material to Spanish speakers, as the majority of free programming courses are in English. The advancement of computing and artificial intelligence is causing the most vulnerable Spanish-speaking sectors to fall behind if they cannot learn to use these new tools. FreeCodingTour.com is a small contribution to help people from different backgrounds who want to learn how to use them.

These courses are not a replacement for other courses, much less for the in-person support of teachers.

Where to continue learning?

There is a lot of free, high-quality material, especially in English, even from very prestigious universities. In each freecodingtour course, you will see several references related to those courses where you can continue learning.
