# Natural Languages, Formal Languages, and AI Testing

I often like to use this quote by Richard Feynman:

> “Pure mathematics is just such an abstraction from the real world, and pure mathematics does have a special precise language for dealing with its own special and technical subjects. But this precise language is not precise in any sense if you deal with real objects of the world, and it is only pedantic and quite confusing to use it unless there are some special subtleties which have to be carefully distinguished.”

I often use this quote to criticize the excessive use of mathematics when explaining a concept as a teacher. But in this case, we’re going the other way around. We are going to recognize the value of mathematics and precise languages.

Recently, several influential people have said that people shouldn’t learn programming languages because computers, with systems like ChatGPT, can now do it for you. Let’s analyze why this makes no sense:

* Mathematics is a special language that was invented long before the creation of computers, to communicate ideas in a very precise way to other people.
* Algorithms are part of mathematics and were also created thousands of years before computers. They are another way to communicate ideas that consist of several steps in a precise way to other people.
* Programming languages are also part of mathematics. They are variations of mathematical language used to describe algorithms and are useful for communicating ideas precisely to both people and computers.

So, if you say that people don’t need to learn programming languages, you need to make it very clear that they will still need to learn a lot of mathematics. If you don’t make this clarification, you’re implying that people don’t need to learn algorithms or mathematics, and that people don’t need to be precise when communicating—which simply doesn’t make any sense.

There’s another problem: if you’re going to talk to a computer so that the computer creates a program for you, but you don’t understand the computer’s response, then the communication is already doomed.

So today, you probably need to learn programming more than ever.

Another related problem that is arising with the use of natural language to create algorithms is testing. Algorithms created using precise languages are easy to test, whereas algorithms created using natural language are very hard—or nearly impossible—to test. Let’s see why:

* The purpose of a precise language like mathematics or a programming language is that, when you communicate an idea, any person or computer reading that idea will understand or interpret exactly the same thing.
* If you use natural language to communicate an idea, then each person—or computer—will interpret that idea differently, depending on their own knowledge. Even you may interpret your own idea differently as time goes by and you acquire new knowledge.
* Testing an algorithm or theorem is a fundamental property of mathematics. If you use mathematics and prove something, then it doesn’t matter if other people like it or not. If mathematics shows that your algorithm works, then it works for you, for the rest of the creatures in this universe, and in any other parallel universe. That is the power of mathematics.

So if you want to test something, you need any judge (human or computer) to produce the same score. But if you use a natural language like English instead of a formal language like a programming language, then you have no control over the judges, and they will interpret your solution however they want—making it impossible to get the same score from different judges.
